A simple web app created based on the Javascript Tip Calculator by Carolyn Hemmings
which can be found at: https://codepen.io/cphemm/pen/reNwWd

The purpose of this project is to learn how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together,
and to learn how to create a web app. 

This web app lets the user input the value of their bill, the tip they would like to
give, and the number of people splitting the bill. It then outputs each person's contribution
towards the tip.
